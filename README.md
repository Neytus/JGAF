The goal is to design and implement a software tool for working with various representations of formal languages.

How to work with the tool:

1. Download contents of the repository and unzip them.

2. Open the project in your Java IDE. 

3. All the necessary libraries are included in folder "lib", include them if necessary. 

4. You can compile/build the project.
